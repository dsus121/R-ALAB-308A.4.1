#R-ALAB 308A.4.1: Working with External Data 
#### introduction to using the Cat Api

##### Objectives
- Request data from an external API using fetch and Axios.
- Create an interactive, dynamic webpage that serves content from an external API.
- Use async/await and Promises to create synchronous logic in asynchronous actions.
- Using fetch or Axios, POST data to and DELETE data from an external API.


##### Notes
The instructions and resources for this lab were wretched. A rewrite is in order. It's impossible to show the pivot from using fetch() to Axios in a single file. Also, combining the carousel with choosing favourites and displaying them was arduous. Not my favourite activity, though I did learn quite a few new ways to break and repair my code.
