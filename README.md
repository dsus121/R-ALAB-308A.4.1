#### introduction to using the Cat Api

Created an async function "initialLoad" that does the following: 
[ ] Retrieve a list of breeds from the cat API using fetch().
[ ] Create new <options> for each of these breeds, and append them to breedSelect.
[ ] Each option should have a value attribute equal to the id of the breed.
[ ] Each option should display text equal to the name of the breed.
[ ] This function should execute immediately.
